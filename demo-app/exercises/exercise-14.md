## Option 2

1. Upgrade the Car Tool application to pass the car tool store on the context similar to the Color Tool applicaton. But, instead of a single container named Car Tool. I would like two containers. One container should connect the Car Table to the store. One container should connect the Car Form to the store. DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE IN CAR TABLE OR CAR FORM AT ALL. You may change the code in Car Tool.
